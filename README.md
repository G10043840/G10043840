Hi, I'm @G10043840
I'm interested in making better use of the R that I know for the design and analysis of experiments.  It could extend to more data science.
I'm currently learning to use ggplot for better graphs and to better my R usage.
I'm not certain about collaborations yet, as I am not sure of what I can contribute.
I can be reached at glenngee513@outlook.com
